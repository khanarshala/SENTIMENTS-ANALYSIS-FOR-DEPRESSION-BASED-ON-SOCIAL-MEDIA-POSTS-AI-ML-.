By analyzing linguistic markers in social media posts, it’s possible to create a deep learning model that can give an individual insight into his or her mental health far earlier than traditional approaches.
More than 300 million people suffer from depression and only a fraction of them receive adequate treatment.Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and nearly 800,000 people every year die due to suicide.
Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds. Diagnoses (and subsequent treatment) for depression are often delayed, imprecise, and/or missed entirely.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Social media provides an unprecedented opportunity to transform early depression intervention services, particularly in young adults.
Every second, approximately 6,000 Tweets are tweeted on Twitter, which corresponds to over 350,000 tweets sent per minute, 500 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year.
Pew Research Center states that currently, 72% of public uses some type of social media.
Because depression is an illness that so often requires the self-reporting of symptoms, social media posts provide a rich source of data and information that can be used to train an efficient model.
