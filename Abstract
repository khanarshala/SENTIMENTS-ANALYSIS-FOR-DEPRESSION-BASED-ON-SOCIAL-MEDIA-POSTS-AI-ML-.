Abstract
Purpose: Social networks have been developed as a great point for its users to communicate with their interested
friends and share their opinions, photos, and videos refecting their moods, feelings and sentiments. This creates an
opportunity to analyze social network data for userâ€™s feelings and sentiments to investigate their moods and attitudes
when they are communicating via these online tools.
Methods: Although diagnosis of depression using social networks data has picked an established position globally, there are several dimensions that are yet to be detected. In this study, we aim to perform depression analysis on
Facebook data collected from an online public source. To investigate the efect of depression detection, we propose
machine learning technique as an efcient and scalable method.
Results: We report an implementation of the proposed method. We have evaluated the efciency of our proposed
method using a set of various psycholinguistic features. We show that our proposed method can signifcantly improve
the accuracy and classifcation error rate. In addition, the result shows that in diferent experiments Decision Tree (DT)
gives the highest accuracy than other ML approaches to fnd the depression.
Conclusions: Machine learning techniques identify high quality solutions of mental health problems among Facebook users.
